Grocery Budget 
========================
By: Katelynn Barlowe

## Project Description
Manage a grocery list budget. First, plan your trip by making your list of items you need (grouped by area of the store or food groups or however you want!) along with a quantity and estimated unit cost. Add items until you reach your budgeted amount. Then in the store, use your list and adjust your items by putting in the actual unit cost (round up to the nearest 25 cent). Watch your amount available change - allowing you to make on-the-fly item changes based on how much or how little you have left. Put stuff back if you've gone over or add more if you have extra. 

This is a Sandbox Project used for me (Katelynn) to learn Vue and Ruby on Rails. There are many things I'd like to add at a later time as I continue to learn. 

## Setup
```
rake db:migrate
yarn install
ruby bin\rails server
```
The Vue app is setup to reference localhost:3000 for the Ruby server. You also need local redis running.
